These components should handle user input and authentication logic. Since you want to store the data on the cloud, you will need to enable Supabase.\n3.  **Dashboard:** Create a dashboard component that displays the user's current diet and previously generated menus. This component will need to fetch data from the cloud (Supabase) after the user is authenticated.\n4.  **Navigation:** Implement navigation between the home screen, sign-in/sign-up screens, and the dashboard.\n\nAfter the code changes are implemented, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-07T15:13:32.148526"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this mobile app for generating unlimited menus for specific diets.

Now I've implemented a comprehensive authentication guard system for your app. Here's what I've done:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n### 1. **Root Layout (`app/_layout.tsx`)**\n- Created a new `RootLayoutNav` component that uses the `useAuth` hook to check authentication status\n- Implemented navigation guards using `useSegments` and `useRootNavigationState` to monitor route changes\n- Added automatic redirects:\n  - **Unauthenticated users** trying to access protected routes (tabs, diet, menus) \u2192 redirected to `/auth/signin`\n  - **Authenticated users** on auth screens \u2192 redirected to `/(tabs)/dashboard`\n- Added console logs for debugging navigation flow\n\n### 2. **Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` and `index.ios.tsx`)**\n- Added authentication check with `useEffect`\n- Automatically redirects authenticated users to the dashboard\n- Shows a loading state while checking authentication\n- Only displays the welcome/landing page for unauthenticated users\n\n### 3. **Dashboard Screen (`app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx`)**\n- Added authentication check to ensure only authenticated users can access it\n- Redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in page\n- Shows loading state while checking authentication\n- Returns `null` if user is not authenticated (prevents flash of content)\n\n## How It Works\n\n**For Unauthenticated Users:**\n- When the app starts, they see the Home/Welcome screen\n- If they try to navigate to Dashboard, Profile, Diet Selection, or Menu History, they're automatically redirected to Sign In\n- They can only access the Sign In and Sign Up screens\n\n**For Authenticated Users:**\n- After signing in, they're automatically redirected to the Dashboard\n- If they try to go back to the Home screen, they're redirected to Dashboard\n- They have full access to all protected routes (Dashboard, Profile, Diet Selection, Menu History)\n- The Home screen automatically redirects them to Dashboard\n\n**Sign Out Flow:**\n- When users sign out (from the Profile screen), the `user` state becomes `null`\n- The navigation guard detects this and redirects them to the Sign In screen\n- They can no longer access protected routes until they sign in again\n\nThe authentication state is managed by the `AuthContext` and persisted in `AsyncStorage`, so users remain signed in even after closing the app!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "c23e92cdb971129c0521027d6587375eaa449529", "message": "feat: Implement authentication guards and route redirects", "timestamp": "2025-12-07T15:29:45Z", "files_changed": ["app/_layout.tsx", "app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.ios.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx"], "update_number": 2, "parent_commit_id": "aca41789847b66941c08416d0b4bf7c761010fd9"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-07T15:25:47Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "My App on Expo.go Looks completely diffrent Why is that?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "There could be several reasons why your app looks different on Expo Go than you expect. Here are some common causes:\n\n1.  **Unsaved Changes:** Make sure you've saved all your changes in your code editor. Expo Go displays the most recently saved version of your app.\n2.  **Metro Bundler Issues:** The Metro bundler might not be picking up your latest changes. Try restarting the bundler by closing the Expo Go app and running `npx expo start` again in your terminal. You can also try clearing the Metro bundler cache using the `-c` flag: `npx expo start -c`.\n3.  **Platform-Specific Code:** You might have platform-specific code (e.g., using `index.ios.tsx` or `index.android.tsx`) that is causing differences between iOS and Android. Ensure that your code is consistent across platforms or that you're testing on the correct platform.\n4.  **Cached Data:** Expo Go might be using cached data. Try clearing the app's cache by uninstalling and reinstalling the Expo Go app on your device.\n5.  **Dependency Issues:** There might be issues with your dependencies. Try deleting your `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` or `yarn install` again to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.\n6.  **Expo Updates:** If you've recently updated Expo, there might be compatibility issues.

The authentication should work correctly, and the app should look more consistent on Expo Go. The app will:\n\n1. Store your credentials locally\n2. Remember your session\n3. Redirect you to the dashboard after successful sign-in/sign-up\n4.

Instead, they just call `signOut()` and let the navigation logic in `_layout.tsx` handle the redirect automatically.\n\n2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added more detailed console logs throughout the authentication flow to help track what's happening during sign-out.\n\n3. **Improved Navigation Logic**: The `useEffect` in `_layout.tsx` now properly detects when the user state changes to `null` and automatically redirects to the welcome screen.\n\n### How It Works Now:\n\n1. User clicks \"Sign Out\" button\n2. Confirmation dialog appears\n3. User confirms sign out\n4. `signOut()` function is called:\n   - Clears user session from AsyncStorage\n   - Sets user state to `null`\n5.

This is crucial for debugging, monitoring user behavior, and understanding app usage patterns. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1.  **Centralized Logging Service:** Implement a centralized logging service within the app. This service will be responsible for capturing all relevant events and data.\n2.  **Comprehensive Event Tracking:** Identify key user actions and app events that need to be logged. This includes:\n\n    *   Authentication events (sign-in, sign-up, sign-out)\n    *   Diet selection changes\n    *   Menu generation requests\n    *   Profile updates (username, profile picture)\n    *   Navigation events (screen transitions)\n    *   Errors and exceptions\n3.  **Detailed Log Data:** For each event, capture relevant information such as:\n\n    *   Timestamp\n    *   User ID\n    *   Event type\n    *   Event-specific data (e.g., diet type selected, new username, error message)\n4.  **Logging Implementation:** Integrate the logging service into the appropriate components and functions throughout the app. Use `console.log` for development and debugging, but consider using a more robust logging library for production to handle log levels, formatting, and storage.\n5.  **Log Storage:** Determine where the logs will be stored. For development, you can use the console or a local file. For production, consider using a cloud-based logging service like Sentry, Bugsnag, or a custom logging endpoint.\n6.  **Privacy Considerations:** Be mindful of user privacy and avoid logging sensitive information such as passwords or personal data without proper consent.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-07T17:09:39.000128"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement comprehensive logging for all user actions and changes in the app. Let me first search for relevant information about logging in React Native apps.Let me read the current file structure to understand the app better:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "contexts/AuthContext.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "contexts/MenuContext.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/diet/select.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "utils/errorLogger.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read a few more files to understand the app structure better:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/auth/signin.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/auth/signup.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/menus/history.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!

When triggered, the system should generate a new meal plan based on the same diet and goal date.\n*   **Date Goal Integration:** The UI should include a date picker where users can specify their target date.

I've successfully implemented the survey feature. Here's what I've created:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n### 1. **New Survey Screen** (`app/auth/survey.tsx`)\nA comprehensive 6-step onboarding survey that collects:\n- **Step 1**: Weight (in kg)\n- **Step 2**: Age (in years)\n- **Step 3**: Height (in cm)\n- **Step 4**: Goals (text area for user's objectives)\n- **Step 5**: End Date (date picker for diet goal completion)\n- **Step 6**: Diet Selection (choose from all available diet types)\n\n**Features:**\n- Beautiful step-by-step UI with progress bar\n- Input validation for each step\n- Back/Next navigation between steps\n- Complete button on final step\n- All data is logged to activity logs\n- Data is saved to AsyncStorage via AuthContext\n\n### 2. **Updated Signup Flow** (`app/auth/signup.tsx`)\n- Changed redirect from dashboard to survey after successful signup\n- Users now go through: Sign Up \u2192 Survey \u2192 Dashboard\n\n### 3. **Enhanced AuthContext** (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)\nAdded new user profile fields:\n- `weight`: User's weight in kg\n- `age`: User's age in years\n- `height`: User's height in cm\n- `goals`: User's fitness/diet goals\n- `dietEndDate`: Target date for completing diet\n- `selectedDiet`: ID of chosen diet plan\n- `surveyCompletedAt`: Timestamp of survey completion\n\n### 4. **Updated Navigation** (`app/_layout.tsx`)\n- Added survey route to the navigation stack\n- Updated navigation logic to allow survey access for authenticated users\n\n## Logging Implementation\n\nAll survey data is comprehensively logged:\n- Survey start event\n- Each step completion\n- Individual field recordings (weight, age, height, goals, end date, diet)\n- Survey completion with full data payload\n- All logs include user ID, username, and timestamps\n\n## User Experience\n\n1. User signs up with name, email, and password\n2. Immediately redirected to survey\n3. Goes through 6 intuitive steps with clear icons and descriptions\n4. Can navigate back to previous steps if needed\n5. All inputs are validated before proceeding\n6. Upon completion, receives success message\n7. Redirected to dashboard with complete profile\n\nThe survey data is now stored in AsyncStorage and logged in the activity logs, making it easy to track user onboarding and preferences! \ud83c\udf89"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-12-07T17:44:22Z"}]
